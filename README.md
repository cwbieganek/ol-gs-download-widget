# OpenLayers with WFS Layer Download Widget

This OpenLayers application implements a GeoServer WFS layer download control. It takes advantage of the outputFormat parameter supported by Web Feature Services. The user can select the WFS layer they would like to download, and one of the following formats:

- Shapefile
- CSV
- KMZ
- GeoJSON

This has traditionally been challenging to implement using the ESRI ArcGIS API for JavaScript. I wanted to show how easy it can be using OpenLayers and GeoServer Web Feature Services.
